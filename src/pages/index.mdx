# Gatsby Starter Catalyst Onepage

[Documentation](https://github.com/ehowey/gatsby-theme-catalyst-onepage) is available on Github.

This is a child theme for `gatsby-theme-catalyst-core` and extends the core themes functionality to add single page navigation using anchor links and [react-scroll](https://github.com/fisshy/react-scroll).

Internal links work and the navigation bar retains it's functionality.

- [Page 1](/page-1)
- [Page 2](/page-2)
- [Page 3](/page-3)

Unfortunately there is a bug with `gatsby-remark-autolink-headers` plugin and MDX at this time so you need to revert to using html in MDX or components which specify a section ID. This will hopefully be addressed soon enabling raw MDX content with specified section IDs that work with the anchor links.

```
<section id="#section1">
...content here
</section>
```

<Section1 />

<Section2 />

<Section3 />
