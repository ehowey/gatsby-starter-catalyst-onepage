# Gatsby Starter Catalyst Onepage

[Documentation](https://github.com/ehowey/gatsby-theme-catalyst-onepage) is available on Github.

This is a child theme for `gatsby-theme-catalyst-core` and extends the core themes functionality to add single page navigation using anchor links and [react-scroll](https://github.com/fisshy/react-scroll).

Unfortunately the `gatsby-remark-autolink-headers` plugin is not working properly with MDX at this time so you need to revert to using html in MDX or components which specify a section ID. This will hopefully be addressed soon enabling raw MDX content with specified section IDs.

```
<section id="#section1">
...content here
</section>
```

<Section1 />

<Section2 />

<Section3 />
